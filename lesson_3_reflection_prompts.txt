When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share repo with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To isolate my own work from changes made by others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - intent to change a codebase and create an entirely new version of it
    Clone - intent to do work that updates a codebase
    Branch - temporarily isolate work in progress on a codebase

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to see latest changes made locally

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Share zip files. Git is easier

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To isolate the changes until they are ready to be shared or to try experimental changes.
    Benefit of working directly in master is no need to merge.
